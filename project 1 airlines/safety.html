    <h1>INDIAN AIRLINES-SAFETY</h1>
    <p>Aviation safety is the study and practice of managing risks in aviation. This includes preventing aviation accidents and incidents through research, educating air travel personnel, passengers and the general public, as well as the design of aircraft and aviation infrastructure. The aviation industry is subject to significant regulations and oversight</p>

    <P>In the early years of air travel, accidents were exceedingly common. 1929 was named the year of "The Great Crash" due to the frequency of aircraft accidents that occurred during the year, with 24 fatal accidents officially reported.[5] In 1928 and 1929, the overall accident rate was about 1 in every million miles (1.6 million kilometers) flown.[5] In today's industry, that accident rate would translate to about 7,000 fatal accidents each year.</P>
